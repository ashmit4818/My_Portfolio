# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **Portfolio Website** - an interactive platform showcasing my projects, skills, and experience. This website is built using **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Aceternity UI** components, offering a sleek and modern UI for desktop users. While the site is fully responsive, the **3D effects**  are optimized for the **desktop version**, so for the best experience, please view it on a desktop.

This project was created to deepen my understanding of frontend development, modern UI libraries, and TypeScript.
